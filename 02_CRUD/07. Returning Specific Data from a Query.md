### Projection Document

To specify fields to include or exclude in the result set, add a projection document as the second parameter in the call to the `db.collection.find()`

Syntax
```
db.collection.find(<query>, <projection>)
```

### Include a Field

To include a field, set its value to 1 in the projection document

Syntax
```
db.collection.find(<query>, {<field>: 1})
```

e.g
```
db.inspections.find({sector: 'Restaurant - 818'}, {business_name: 1, result: 1})
```

### Exclude a Field

To exclude a field, set its value to 0 in the projection document.

Syntax:
```
db.collection.find(<query>, {<field>: 0, <field>: 0})
```
e.g
```
db.inspections.find(
    { result: { $in: ['Pass','Warning]}},
    { date: 0, "address.zip": 0}
)
```

While the `_id` field is included by default, it can be suppressed by setting its value to 0 in any projection.

```
db.inspections.find(
    {sector: 'Restaurant - 818'},
    { business_name: 1, result: 1, _id: 0}
)
```
