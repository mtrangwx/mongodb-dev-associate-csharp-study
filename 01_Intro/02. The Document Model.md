### Data types supported by MongoDB by using BSON
- Number (integer, float)
- Object
- Array
- ObjectId: A data type that creates unique identifiers for the required _id field

**Note _id**: is a required field in every MongoDB document but it's not a data type. If an inserted document does not include an _id field, MongoDB will automatically create the _id field and populate it with a value of type ObjectId

## Document
A basic unit of data in MongoDB. Document data displayed in JSON but stored in BSON which is a Binary JSON, an extension of JSON, which can store additional data types including: Dates, Numbers, ObjectIds

## Collection
A grouping of documents

## Database
A container for collections
