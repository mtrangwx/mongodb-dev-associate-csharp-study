7. A collection has documents like the following:

 { _id: 1, name: 'Oatmeal Fruit Cake with Gummy Bears ', price: 11)},
 { _id: 2, name: 'Cheesecake Trifle with Chocolate Sprinkles ', price: 14)},
 { _id: 3, name: 'Pistachio Brownie with Walnuts ', price: 5},
 { _id: 4, name: 'Strawberry Ice Cream Cake with Butterscotch Syrup ', price: 3)}
How should the 'autocomplete' index be defined to look for matches at the beginning of a word on the name field?

(Choose 1)

a. {  "mappings": {    "dynamic": false,    "fields": {         "name": [   {  "type": "autocomplete",                              "tokenization": "regexCaptureGroup"} ]     } }}
b. {  "mappings": {    "dynamic": false,    "fields": {         "name": [   {  "type": "autocomplete",                              "tokenization": "edgeGram"} ]    } }}
c. {  "mappings": {    "dynamic": false,    "fields": {         "name": [   {  "type": "autocomplete",                              "tokenization": "nGram"} ]    } }}
d. {  "mappings": {    "dynamic": false,    "fields": {         "name": [   {  "type": "autocomplete",                              "tokenization": "matchNGram"}} ]     } }}

**"matchNGram"** is not a valid tokenization algorithm.
**"nGram"** tokenization does not look only at the beginning of a word.
**"regexCaptureGroup"** tokenization does not look only at the beginning of a word.
**edgeGram**: This option correctly specifies the tokenization method as "edgeGram." The edgeGram tokenizer breaks text into n-grams (substrings of a specified length) starting from the beginning of the text. In this case, it will create n-grams from the start of each word in the name field, allowing for matches at the beginning of a word.


### Where is the MongoDB configuration file usually located?
answer: /etc/mongod.conf

### MongoDB connection pooling as managed by the MongoDB driver.

Which of the following settings would correctly configure the MongoDB driver to use a connection pool with a maximum of 50 connections?

mongodb://localhost:27017/mydb?maxPoolSize=50

Explanation
The maxPoolSize parameter in the MongoDB URI string is the correct way to configure the maximum number of connections in the connection pool. Setting maxPoolSize=50 correctly limits the pool to 50 connections, which helps balance performance and resource usage.

Explanation
The mongodb+srv:// scheme is used for DNS Seed List connections, typically for clusters, and not for specifying individual nodes or ports. While maxPoolSize=50 is correct, the scheme mongodb+srv://localhost:27017 is invalid for this purpose.



Connection pooling involves the process of creating and managing a pool of sockets, which are then used by client applications to connect and interact with the MongoDB database.

Connection pooling in MongoDB involves creating and managing a pool of sockets (i.e., connections). These connections are then used by different client applications to interact with the MongoDB database. This increases performance because opening and closing connections for each request can be costly in terms of resources and time.

MongoDB drivers handle the creation and management of indexes, improving query performance.

Explanation
MongoDB drivers play a role in index creation and management. They provide methods and APIs to create, modify, and delete indexes on MongoDB collections. Indexes significantly improve query performance by allowing faster data retrieval based on specific query conditions.

### MongoDB driver connection pool



### Operators $elemMatch and $[]
db.orders.deleteMany(
    { "items": { $elemMatch: { "product": "Mouse" } } }
)

Explanation: Although $elemMatch can be useful in complex queries, it's redundant here. The correct query is simpler and achieves the same result without the need for $elemMatch. This operator is better suited for cases where multiple conditions on array elements need to be matched simultaneously.

db.orders.deleteMany(
    { "items.$[elem].product": "Mouse" }
)

Explanation: The $[] positional operator is used for updating array elements and cannot be used directly in a delete query. This syntax is invalid for a deleteMany operation.


### $in, $elemMatch

**$in**: Using the $in operator for nested array elements.

Explanation
The $in operator is used to filter documents where the value of a field equals any value in the specified array. It doesn't optimize the retrieval of nested documents.

**$elemMatch** operator.

Explanation
While the $elemMatch operator is a powerful tool for querying array elements, it doesn't necessarily optimize the retrieval of specific subdocuments within complex, nested structures.

**Storing frequently accessed subdocuments as separate documents and linking them with references**
Explanation
When dealing with complex, nested structures, it is often more efficient to store frequently accessed subdocuments as separate documents and link them with references. This strategy can reduce the amount of data fetched in each query and can lead to improved query performance.

**Using the dot notation to query nested documents.**
Explanation
While dot notation allows you to access fields in nested documents, it does not inherently optimize the process of fetching specific subdocuments within complex, nested structures.

### Indexing
You are working on a movie database where each movie document contains the following fields: title, releaseYear, director, genres (an array of strings), and ratings (a subdocument containing fields for imdb and rottenTomatoes). The application frequently queries movies by genre, release year, and IMDb rating. You need to ensure that these queries are efficient and perform well, even as the dataset grows. Which of the following strategies would most effectively improve query performance for the described use case? (Select two)

1. Create a compound index on genres and releaseYear, and a separate index on ratings.imdb. (YES)
This strategy can also effectively improve query performance, particularly if queries commonly filter by genres and releaseYear together, while ratings.imdb is often queried separately or in conjunction with other fields. The separate index on ratings.imdb ensures that queries filtering only by IMDb rating are still efficient. However, it may be slightly less optimal than a single compound index if most queries involve all three fields.

2. Create a single compound index on genres, releaseYear, and ratings.imdb. (YES)
A compound index on these fields is the most efficient way to optimize queries that filter on all three criteria (genres, releaseYear, and ratings.imdb). MongoDB will be able to use this index to efficiently filter and sort the results, making queries that involve these fields much faster. The order of the fields in the index should reflect the query patterns, with the most selective field first.

3. Create individual indexes on genres, releaseYear, and ratings.imdb. (NO)
While individual indexes can be beneficial, they are less effective than a compound index in this scenario. Queries filtering on multiple fields would need to use multiple indexes, which may not be as efficient as a single compound index designed for the specific query patterns. Additionally, MongoDB's query optimizer might have difficulty choosing the best index to use, potentially leading to suboptimal performance.

You are tasked with developing a high-performance application using MongoDB as your primary database. The application heavily relies on queries that retrieve user profiles based on user names and their location. Given this requirement, you decide to implement a strategy to make these queries more efficient. What strategy should you implement to ensure these queries are covered queries?

Create a compound index on the username and location fields and project only these two fields in the queries.

Explanation
A covered query is one in which all the fields in the query are part of an index, and all the fields returned in the query are in the same index. MongoDB can match the query conditions and return the result fields using the same index without having to examine any documents. This strategy can greatly improve query performance.

### Querying
You are developing a MongoDB application to manage a library system. The books collection contains documents representing each book, and each document has an authors field, which is an array of strings containing the names of the authors. You need to find all books authored by exactly two specific authors, "John Doe" and "Jane Smith". Which of the following queries correctly identifies all documents in the books collection where the authors field exactly matches the two authors, "John Doe" and "Jane Smith"?

db.books.find({ "authors": { $size: 2, $all: ["John Doe", "Jane Smith"] } })

This query correctly identifies documents where the authors array contains exactly two elements, "John Doe" and "Jane Smith", in any order. The $size operator ensures that the array has exactly two elements, and the $all operator ensures that both specified elements are present.

### Positional operator

{
    "_id": ObjectId("612e3f7d1c4fdb22b8c9b745"),
    "title": "The Matrix",
    "genre": "Science Fiction",
    "ratings": [
        {"user": "JohnDoe", "rating": 5},
        {"user": "JaneDoe", "rating": 4.5}
    ],
    "availability": true
}

Your task is to update the ratings array of a specific movie to change a user's rating. For example, if "JohnDoe" rated the movie again and gave it a rating of 4, the ratings array should reflect this new rating. Which of the following MongoDB update commands will correctly update JohnDoe's rating to 4?

db.movies.updateOne(
   { "title": "The Matrix", "ratings.user": "JohnDoe" },
   { $set: { "ratings.$.rating": 4 } }
)

This query finds the movie by title and checks within the ratings array for an element where user equals "JohnDoe". The $ positional operator identifies the first matching array element and updates its rating field to 4. This is a standard method for updating a specific element in an array based on a query condition.

### Basic syntax for aggregation in MongoDB

How can we present the basic syntax for aggregation in MongoDB?

db.myCollection.aggregate([
    { stage 1},
    { stage 2},
    ...,
    { stage N},
], { options })

### Bulk write
```
db.sales.bulkWrite([
  { insertOne: { name: "Product A", quantity: 10 } },
  { insertOne: { name: "Product B", quantity: 5 } }
])
```

**Explanation**
In MongoDB, to insert multiple documents into a collection using the bulk write operation, you can use the bulkWrite() method on the collection object and pass an array of write operations as the argument. The syntax would be db.collection_name.bulkWrite([{ write_operation1 }, { write_operation2 }, ..., { write_operationN }]) where collection_name is the name of the collection you want to insert into and each { write_operation } is an operation you want to perform such as insertOne for inserting one document.


### aggregate totalRevenue, totalQuantity

{
   "_id" : ObjectId("5f5f95aae2e85f9e7b33be5a"),
   "product_id" : "P001",
   "sale_date" : ISODate("2022-05-01T08:00:00Z"),
   "quantity_sold" : 10,
   "total_revenue" : 100
}

Correct aggregate

```
db.sales.aggregate([
  {
    $group: {
      _id: { month: { $month: "$sale_date" }, year: { $year: "$sale_date" } },
      totalQty: { $sum: "$quantity_sold" },
      totalRevenue: { $sum: "$total_revenue" }
    }
  },
  { $match: { totalRevenue: { $gt: 50000 } } }
])
```

Explanation
The correct pipeline first groups the documents by the month and year of the "sale_date" field, and calculates the total quantity sold and total revenue for each month. It then filters the result set to only include months with a total revenue greater than $50,000 using the $match stage.

### Syntax for $lookup

What is the correct syntax to perform a $lookup operation in MongoDB to combine documents from two collections, employees and departments, based on the "department_id" field in the employees collection and the "_id" field in the departments collection?

```db.employees.aggregate([
  {
    $lookup: {
      from: "departments",
      localField: "department_id",
      foreignField: "_id",
      as: "department_info"
    }
  }
])
```
It uses the correct syntax for the $lookup operation in the MongoDB aggregation framework. The from field specifies the target collection, which is "departments" in this case. The localField field specifies the field in the "employees" collection to match, which is "department_id". The foreignField field specifies the field in the "departments" collection to match, which is "_id". Finally, the as field specifies the name of the output field where the joined documents will be stored, which is "department_info".

### MongoDB connection pool
Connection pooling involves the process of creating and managing a pool of sockets, which are then used by client applications to connect and interact with the MongoDB database.


### Which of the following scenarios is best suited for applying the Attribute Pattern?
Some fields share a similar characteristics, and you want to search across those fields.

Explanation
The Attribute Pattern is best suited for scenarios where different fields share similar characteristics, and you want to search or perform operations across those fields. By applying the Attribute Pattern, you can group related attributes into arrays or sub-documents, allowing you to query or manipulate data more efficiently and logically.

### Design MongoDB
You're developing a MongoDB application where you need to run a time-intensive aggregation operation on a collection frequently. The operation doesn't require real-time data and can tolerate some delay in data freshness. Which approach would be the most suitable to reduce the load on the primary database and optimize the performance?

Use a secondary read preference for the aggregation operation.

Explanation
By using a secondary read preference, the time-intensive aggregation operation can be offloaded to a secondary member of the replica set, reducing the load on the primary database. Since the operation can tolerate some delay in data freshness, this approach is suitable.

### Design real-time analytical dashboard

In MongoDB, consider a situation where you need to implement a real-time analytical dashboard for an e-commerce site. The dashboard will display real-time statistics such as the most viewed products, current active users, the most popular product categories, etc. Which of the following MongoDB features would you utilize to implement this real-time dashboard effectively?

Change Streams

Explanation
This is the most appropriate feature to use for implementing a real-time dashboard. Change Streams allow applications to access real-time data changes without the complexity and risk of tailing the oplog. Applications can use change streams to subscribe to all data changes on a single collection, a database, or an entire deployment, and immediately react to them.

GridFS is a specification for storing and retrieving large files such as images or audio files. It's not suitable for real-time analytics.

### sorting on fields that contain missing values (i.e., values that are not present in all documents in the collection)

Missing values are sorted first.

Explanation
In MongoDB, when sorting on a field that is missing in some documents, those documents are treated as if they have null values for that field. MongoDB sorts null values (and thus missing values) first, before other values.


### $sortByCount

$sortByCount is a simple way to group documents by a certain field (city in this case) and count the number of documents in each group, followed by sorting the results by count in descending order. $sortByCount expects a field expression.

### Using the findAndModify method with { new: true } option.
The { new: true } option ensures that the modified document is returned upon modification. This is essential in handling concurrent requests, as it allows each request to work with the most recent version of the document.

### $addField to add field to each document
db.players.aggregate([{
    $addFields: {
        total_score: {
            $sum: '$scores'
        },
        avg_score: {
            $avg: '$scores'
        }
    }
}, {
    $addFields: {
        total_score_with_bonus: {
            $add: ['$total_score', '$bonus']
        }
    }
}])

In this query, we use the $addFields stage to add the desired fields to each document. First, we add the total_score field by using the $sum operator on the scores array. Then, we add the avg_score field by using the $avg operator on the scores array. Finally, we add the total_score_with_bonus field by using the $add operator to add the total_score and bonus fields together.

### Mongorestore, mongodump, mongoexport, mongoimport

**mongorestore**: This command is used to restore data from a binary backup created by mongodump or similar tools. It can directly add a collection that is stored in a BSON file to a MongoDB cluster.

**mongodump**: This command is used to create a binary backup of data from a MongoDB database. It does not directly add a collection to a MongoDB cluster.


**mongoexport**: This command is used to export data from a MongoDB database to a file, such as a JSON or CSV file. It does not directly add a collection to a MongoDB cluster.

**mongoimport**: This command is used to import data from a file, such as a JSON or CSV file, into a MongoDB database. It does not directly add a collection stored in a BSON file to a MongoDB cluster.

### Which cursor method should you use to force MongoDB to use a specific index for a query?

When querying data in MongoDB, the cursor.hint() method is used to force MongoDB to use a specific index for the query. This method allows you to explicitly specify which index MongoDB should utilize for the query. By providing the hint to MongoDB, you can ensure that the query uses the desired index and potentially improve the query performance.

### The `insertedIds`

What is the correct syntax to insert multiple documents into a MongoDB collection named orders and return the _id values for all inserted documents?

db.orders.insertMany([
  { customer: "John Smith", product: "Book" },
  { customer: "Jane Doe", product: "Laptop" }
]).insertedIds

Explanation
In MongoDB, to return the _id values for all inserted documents, you can chain the insertedIds property to the result of the insertMany() method. The syntax would be db.collection_name.insertMany([{ document1 }, { document2 }, ..., { documentN }]).insertedIds where collection_name is the name of the collection you want to insert into and each { document } is a document you want to insert represented as a JavaScript object.

### Randomly select N documents from a sepcific collection

**{ $sample: { size: N}}**: 

{ $sample: { size: 10 } }


Explanation
This is the correct stage to use for randomly selecting documents from a collection. The $sample stage in the Aggregation Framework allows you to specify the size of the sample you want to retrieve. In this case, the size is set to 10, indicating that you want to randomly select 10 documents from the collection.

### Using 'textScore'

```
db.movies.find(
    { $text: { $search: 'spaceship' } }, 
    { score: { $meta: 'textScore' } },
).sort( { score: { $meta: 'textScore' } } ).limit(3)
```

This query utilizes the text search feature of MongoDB. It searches for documents in the movies collection that contain the term "spaceship" and retrieves the relevance score computed by MongoDB for each document. The query then sorts the result set in descending order based on the relevance score using sort() and limits the output to the top three documents using limit(3).

### Using $expr

Given a movies collection where each document has the following structure:



{
    _id: ObjectId('573a1390f29313caabcd60e4'),
    genres: [ 'Short', 'Comedy', 'Drama' ],
    title: 'The Immigrant',
    year: 1917,
    imdb: { rating: 7.8, votes: 4680, id: 8133 },
    countries: [ 'USA' ]
}


Which of the following queries will find all the movies that have more votes than the year in which they were released?

db.movies.find({ $expr: { $gt: ["$imdb.votes", "$year"] } } )

Explanation
This query uses the $expr operator in MongoDB to evaluate the condition that the number of votes is greater than the year of release. The $gt operator compares the values and returns true if the condition is satisfied. This query will find all movies where the number of votes is greater than the year in which they were released.

### The $all operator

**$all : ['A','B']**: Ensures both 'A' and 'B' are checked

```
db.employees.find({
  "hire_date": { "$gt": ISODate("2020-01-01") },
  "skills": { "$all": ["Python", "MongoDB"] }
})
```
Explanation
This query is correct. The "$gt" operator is used to find employees hired after January 1, 2020, and the "$all" operator ensures that only employees with both "Python" and "MongoDB" in their skills array are returned.

### Capped collection

What command can you use to create a capped collection named latest_news that will be limited to 3 documents and 10,000 bytes?

```
db.createCollection('latest_news', {'capped': true, 'size': 10000, 'max': 3})
```
Explanation
This is the correct command to create a capped collection named latest_news with a limit of 3 documents and 10,000 bytes. The 'capped' option specifies that the collection is capped, meaning it has a maximum size and follows a FIFO (First-In-First-Out) behavior. The 'size' option indicates the maximum size in bytes, and the 'max' option determines the maximum number of documents in the collection.

### Design

Your application uses MongoDB as its primary database and handles financial transactions. Due to the critical nature of these transactions, you decide to configure MongoDB's read concern level to ensure the consistency of data reads. Which of the following read concern levels would you choose if your application requires reading the most recent majority-committed data, even under network partitions or replica set elections?

**local**: This read concern level allows reading data from the primary or secondary and does not ensure that the data is majority-committed. This means it may return data that might be rolled back and is not suitable for applications that require consistent reads

**majority**: The "majority" read concern ensures that the returned data has been confirmed by a majority of the replica set members. It guarantees that the data will not be rolled back under normal circumstances and is ideal for applications that require consistent reads.

**available**: The "available" read concern is the default for reads from replica set secondary members. It does not guarantee that the returned data has been confirmed by a majority of the replica set members and could return data that is uncommitted or might be rolled back in the future.

**snapshot**: The "snapshot" read concern allows consistent reads of data at a single point in time across multiple transactions in a sharded cluster. It doesn't ensure reading the most recent majority-committed data.

### $setOnInsert

db.inventory.updateOne(
  { item: "notebook" },
  { $inc: { quantity: 10 }, $setOnInsert: { price: 5.99 } },
  { upsert: true }
)

Explanation
This option uses $inc to increase the quantity of the notebook if it exists and $setOnInsert to set the price only when a new document is inserted. The upsert: true option ensures that a new document is inserted if the item does not exist in the collection. This is the correct and intended behavior based on the scenario.

### Create mongoDB Views

Consider the following situation: You are a MongoDB Developer and are currently working on an application that requires complex reporting on large amounts of data. The application stores its data in MongoDB, which has grown significantly. To maintain efficiency and manageability, you decide to use MongoDB views. You want to create a view "UsersView" that includes only username, email, and createdAt fields from the Users collection. Which of the following commands would you use?

```

db.createView("UsersView", "Users", [{$project: {username: 1, email: 1, createdAt: 1}}])
```
This is the correct MongoDB syntax to create a view. The createView method takes three arguments: the name of the view to create ("UsersView"), the name of the source collection ("Users"), and an array of aggregation pipeline stages ([{$project: {username: 1, email: 1, createdAt: 1}}]).

### Capped Collection

A company's application logs are stored in a MongoDB capped collection named 'appLogs' in the 'appData' database. Each document contains an 'event' field to store log messages and a 'timestamp' field to record the log creation time. The capped collection has a size limit of 10 GB. The company is introducing a new feature that will result in more log data being produced and wants to ensure that at least the most recent one day of log data is always available in the collection. Which of the following strategies will ensure that at least one day's worth of log data is always available?

1. Correct: Migrate to a new, larger capped collection and copy all existing documents.

Explanation
The best solution is to create a new, larger capped collection and copy the existing documents. This new collection will have sufficient size to hold more than one day's log data. The data will still follow the FIFO (First In First Out) rule when the size limit is reached, ensuring that the most recent log data is retained. Remember that capped collections in MongoDB are fixed-size collections that support high-throughput operations and automatically remove the oldest documents when they reach a specified size limit.

2. Incorrect: Create a new field 'expiry' in every document to mark it for deletion after 24 hours.

Explanation
Adding a new field 'expiry' will not cause documents to be deleted after 24 hours in a capped collection. Automatic deletion based on an expiry field is a feature of TTL indexes, which are not supported in capped collections.

3. Incorrect: Implement a Time-To-Live (TTL) index on the 'timestamp' field with an expiry of 24 hours.

Explanation
TTL indexes are not supported on capped collections in MongoDB. TTL indexes are useful in regular collections for automatically removing documents after a certain period or at a specific clock time.

4. Incorrect: Convert the capped collection to a regular collection.

Explanation
Converting the capped collection to a regular collection does not guarantee the retention of one day's log data. Regular collections do not automatically remove older documents to make space for new ones.

### MongoDB design patterns

A social media company needs to implement a data model that describes te relationships between users. When loading real data into the system, it turned out that one user has too many contacts to store them in the designated array. Instead of redesigning the entire system what pattern can you use?

**The Subset Pattern**: The Subset Pattern involves partitioning or splitting a larger data set into smaller subsets based on certain criteria. However, in this scenario, the problem is not related to partitioning data. It's about finding a solution for storing a large number of contacts for a specific user.

**The Extended Reference Pattern**: The Extended Reference Pattern is used when the relationship between entities becomes too complex to be represented by a simple reference or foreign key. In this case, the issue is not about the complexity of relationships but rather the storage capacity for a specific user's contacts. Hence, this pattern is not the most suitable solution.

**The Schema Versioning Pattern**: This pattern is not directly applicable to the given scenario. Schema versioning is typically used when making changes to the structure of the data model while maintaining backward compatibility with existing data. It doesn't address the issue of storing too many contacts for a single user.

**The Attribute Pattern**: The Attribute Pattern involves adding additional attributes to a data model to accommodate new or optional data. While this pattern can be helpful in certain cases, it doesn't directly address the issue of storing an excessive number of contacts for a single user.

**The Outlier Pattern**:  (C) This pattern involves handling exceptional cases or outliers that don't fit within the standard data model. In this case, if one user has an unusually large number of contacts that cannot be stored in the designated array, the Outlier Pattern could be used to handle this specific situation. It allows for accommodating the outlier user by using an alternative data storage approach specifically for that user.

### Computed Pattern

As a MongoDB Developer you work on an e-learning platform and your task is to model data. Which of the following scenarios is the best candidate to use the Computed Pattern?

A course model needs to store a counter representing the number of times it was purchased.

Using the Computed Pattern would be suitable in this scenario because it involves maintaining a counter that needs to be updated every time a course is purchased. With the Computed Pattern, you can define a computed property or field that automatically updates based on certain conditions or triggers. In this case, the counter could be computed based on the number of purchase events recorded in the system, ensuring the counter stays up to date without requiring manual updates.

### MongoDB URI connection string

You are working on a JavaScript application that needs to connect to a MongoDB replica set distributed across multiple servers. The replica set requires SSL/TLS encryption, and you want to ensure that your application connects securely and optimally to the primary node. The replica set name is myReplica, and the nodes are node1.example.com, node2.example.com, and node3.example.com. You also want to set the write concern to majority to ensure that write operations are acknowledged by a majority of the replica set members. Which of the following URI strings correctly configures the MongoClient to connect to the replica set with SSL/TLS and majority write concern?

1. (C) mongodb://node1.example.com,node2.example.com,node3.example.com/?replicaSet=myReplica&ssl=true&w=majority

Explanation
This URI string correctly configures the MongoClient to connect to the replica set using SSL (ssl=true), ensuring secure communication. It also specifies replicaSet=myReplica to identify the replica set and sets w=majority to ensure that write operations are acknowledged by a majority of the replica set members, which is crucial for data consistency and durability.

2.  mongodb+srv://node1.example.com,node2.example.com,node3.example.com/?replicaSet=myReplica&tls=true&w=majority

Explanation
This URI uses the mongodb+srv:// scheme, which is meant for connecting to clusters using DNS Seed List connection format. However, specifying individual nodes in this format is not valid. Additionally, tls=true is functionally equivalent to ssl=true, but the incorrect scheme makes this option invalid.

3. mongodb://node1.example.com,node2.example.com,node3.example.com/?replicaSet=myReplica&ssl=true&readConcernLevel=majority

Explanation
Although this URI correctly enables SSL and identifies the replica set, it mistakenly configures readConcernLevel=majority instead of the required w=majority. The readConcernLevel controls the consistency level of read operations, not write operations, which is not what the scenario asks for.

4. mongodb://node1.example.com,node2.example.com,node3.example.com/?replicaSet=myReplica&tls=true&w=1

Explanation
This URI uses tls=true correctly for SSL/TLS communication, but it incorrectly sets the write concern to w=1, which only requires acknowledgment from the primary node and does not fulfill the scenario's requirement for majority write concern. This could lead to issues in maintaining data consistency across the replica set.
